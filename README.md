# yr-weather
A simple CLI weather application that pulls data from YR.no

It uses the nice module Weather::YR and pulls the data from that.
Simply run the application with `./yr-weather.pl` and it will pull data from YR.no
and print out a weather forecast. 

Or create an alias to it, like `alias weather='/path/to/yr-weather.pl'`
